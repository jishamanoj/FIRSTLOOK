          In my early 30s, I used various matchmaking and dating apps to find a
          partner. While I encountered many profiles, the limited ways to
          interact didn’t resonate with me. Social media apps, with their
          enhanced communication features, allowed for better interaction.
          However, many users there might be married or not seeking a match.<br/>
          This led to the idea of Firstlook—a social app with communication
          features like social media, but tailored for singles. It’s an
          ID-verified platform, ensuring every profile is authentic.
